        <h1>Welcome to My React Web Page</h1>
        <p>This page was built using Create React App.</p>
        <p>I installed Create React App by running the commands:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>npx create-react-app react-web-page<br></br></code>
          <code>cd react-web-page<br></br></code>
          <code>npm start</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Then, I modified the content in the <code>src/App.js</code> file to create this page.</p>
        <p>
          There were very little difficulties when creating this webpage. <br></br>I was already familiar with using
          React before so there was not much of a challenge going into this.
